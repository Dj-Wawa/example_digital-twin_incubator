# Casper Incubator

- Use incubator for teaching and the book.
- hard to figure out now what to do with it in terms of research
- We need to apply it to other projects (ur robot and robotti).
- We need to incorporate a complex event processor as a way to coordinate.

Homework ahead of next meeting:
- [ ] All: Keywords
  - [ ] traceability (e.g., into-cps OSLC tuples)
  - [ ] configuration management (too much config means less flexibility)
  - [ ] data migration
  - [ ] contract based design
  - [ ] complex event processing
  - [ ] experimental frame
  - [ ] run-time monitoring (LTL, metric LTL, etc...)

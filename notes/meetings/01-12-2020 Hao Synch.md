Bits of information required for Kalman explanation:
- Basic statistics (variance, mean)
  - Covariance might be tricker
- Basic calculus (find minimum of quadratic function)

Hao had a nice explanation for the kalman filter in the one dimensional case.

Hao will: 
- [ ] write down the Kalman filter equations
- [ ] Check the tutorial submission guidelines in:
  - [ ] https://scs.org/annsim/

# Concept of Operations

## Problem Domain

The problem domain revolves around the fermentation of tempeh, a fermented soybean product, using alternative ingredients such as black beans, chickpeas, lentils, or a combination of vegetables. The challenge is to optimize the fermentation process for various ingredients to ensure successful tempeh production.

## Environmental Conditions

The goal is to warm up an air volume to 37 degrees Celsius and maintain a relatively uniform temperature, considering that the environment temperature is generally lower than 37 degrees. Data collection and analysis are assumed to take place on a cloud server.

## Constraints on Solution Domain

The DT system is deployed on a cloud computer.
Users are responsible for the physical incubator's maintenance.
The company operates without physical stores.
Users must have intuitive visualization interfaces for interacting with the DT-enabled system.
Connectivity between the physical tempeh incubator (PT) and the DT system should be straightforward.

### Lifecycle Concepts

- Acquisition: Users have the option to buy the PT and utilize it without DT services or to pay for DT services to enhance their tempeh production process.
- Operations: Users follow the guidelines to set up the PT with scavenged parts and install the provided software. They can monitor the fermentation process manually or with DT-enabled features.
- Deployment: The DT system is hosted on a cloud server, collecting data from millions of incubators worldwide.
- Support: Users receive user manuals and examples to aid maintenance. The DT system provides predictive maintenance support and adapts to new components.
- Retirement: As the technology evolves, the system may undergo updates or upgrades. The retirement phase could involve phasing out older versions of the system.

## Business Requirements and Validation Criteria

- Promotion of Alternative Tempeh Production: The system should actively promote the production of tempeh using alternative ingredients, such as black beans, chickpeas, lentils, and various vegetable combinations, to cater to individuals with soy allergies and those seeking diverse plant-based protein sources.

- Nutritional and Sustainability Enhancement: The system must contribute to enhancing nutrition and food sustainability in regions with limited access to animal protein sources. It should aim to combat protein deficiencies and improve overall nutrition through the provision of alternative protein-rich options.

- Accessibility and Local Empowerment: The system should enable small-scale, local tempeh production, reducing dependence on imported or expensive protein sources. It should empower local communities by providing access to a valuable source of plant-based protein.

- Value-Added DT Services: The system should offer value-added services through the DT-enabled features. These services may include remote monitoring, fermentation state estimation, safety checks, and energy-saving recommendations. The system should enhance users' tempeh production experience and improve the overall quality of tempeh batches.

- User-Friendly Interface: The system's interface must be intuitive and user-friendly, catering to users who may not be tech-savvy. The visualizations and interactions with the DT-enabled system should be easy to understand and conduct.

- Adaptability to Different Ingredients: The system should support the production of tempeh using a variety of alternative ingredients. It should be capable of adjusting fermentation processes to accommodate the unique characteristics of each ingredient, providing diverse flavors, textures, and nutritional profiles.

- Fermentation Process Improvement: The system should contribute to improving the tempeh fermentation process through the utilization of data collected from various incubators worldwide. It should help users achieve consistent and successful fermentation outcomes.

- Remote Accessibility and Cloud Deployment: The system must be accessible remotely through a cloud-based platform. This accessibility ensures that users can interact with the DT-enabled system and utilize its features from any location.

- Support for Maintenance and Troubleshooting: The system should provide support for maintenance by offering predictive maintenance suggestions and adapting to changes in components. It should empower users to perform maintenance tasks and troubleshoot issues with the physical incubator, particularly in remote areas.

- Scalability and Global Reach: The system should be designed to scale and accommodate a large number of users across different regions. It should aim to reach a global audience and contribute to the widespread adoption of alternative tempeh production methods.

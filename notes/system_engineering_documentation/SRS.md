# System Requirement Specification (SRS)

## Scope

This document describes the requirements of the Incubator system, which is a system intended to be able to cook soybeans in an insulated box. Data will be collected from both inside and outside the box, which will then be relayed to a digital twin, which will ultimatly be used to predict the events happening inside the insulated box, based on the real time data collected and feed to the model. 

The purpose of this system is to prove the capabilties and showcase certain usecases in which a digital twin will prove useful to assist as a tool for predictive maintenance of a physical twin. 

### Terminology 

FR - functional requirement

RI - Risk

DT - Digital Twin 

PT - Physical Twin

MOM - Message oriented middleware

LLD - Low level driver

## Risks

### Technical 
RI1 : The insulated box is not properly insulated

RI2 : Logging of the temperature measurements are inaccurate or represented temporally incorrect 

RI3 : The Current configuration of either the controller og the digital twin are not syncronized correctly or at all

RI4 : Container updates/failures causes some data-loss in the down time

### Cost 
RI5 : Electricity required to keep the heater and fan active are too high due to the usage of low-end hardware

RI6 : The cloud database and monitoring tools used in the design raises their prices increasing cloud costs 

### Programmatic
RI7 : The cloud database and monitoring tools used in the design goes out of service and will decomission the database on tools used by the Digital Twin 


## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

FR1 : The incubator shall be designed to heat fermented soybeans at just below 37 degrees celcius with at most a  $\pm$ 3 degree celcius margin of error

FR2 : The incubator shall be designed to detect whether the lid on the incubator is open or not. In case of an open lid, the box should not try to maintain a temperature of 37 degrees celcius

FR3 : The incubator shall be able to relay temperature measurements inside the insulated container

FR4 : The incubator shall be able to relay temperature measurements outside of the insulated container 

FR5 : A low level driver shall be able to turn on and off the heater via analog signals 

FR6 : A low level driver shall be able to turn on and off the fan via analog signals

FR7 : A message oriented middleware system must control the communication flow between a controller device and the digital twin 

FR8 : A message oriented middelware system must control the communication flow between a low level driver and the controller

FR9 : The Digital Twin must estimate the temperature inside the incubator with a 95% accuracy. 

FR10 : The temperature sensors inside and outside of the incubator should supply enough data to the digital twin, so that it can meet FR9

FR11: The Incubator shall be designed as such that a user may change between different heating strategies (MUST BE SPECIFIED FURTHER)

### Non-functional Requirements 

NFR1 : The controller should be the only component to supply data to the message oriented middleware and also receive all data from the message oriented middleware
